# TDR---Educational-Videogame

## About the project
This project was developed as a final project during my technological high school studies. It involved creating an educational video game designed for use on school computers. The entire project was developed using Unreal Engine 5.  

Handled all aspects of the project, including design and programming. Due to being relatively new to coding at the time, programming blocks with extensive documentation were utilized. This approach significantly enhanced the project's feasibility and manageability.


Feel free to read the project documentation (in Catalan), and reach out for recommendations, questions or even advices!
